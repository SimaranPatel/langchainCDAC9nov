      "content='Romeo and Juliet is one of the most famous and enduring love stories of all time, a tragic tale of young love, passion, and fate. Here is a summary of the story:\\n\\n**Act 1:**\\n\\nThe play begins in Verona, Italy, where we are introduced to the ongoing feud between two prominent families, the House of Capulet and the House of Montague. Despite the animosity between their families, Romeo Montague and Juliet Capulet fall instantly in love when they meet at a masked ball hosted by the Capulets. \\n\\nRomeo, captivated by Juliet\\'s beauty, approaches her and they share a passionate dance. They soon learn each other\\'s identities and realize the depth of the conflict between their families, but this only intensifies their feelings for each other. \\n\\n**Act 2:**\\n\\nRomeo and Juliet secretly marry the very next day, with the help of Juliet\\'s Nurse and Friar Lawrence, who hopes that this union might end the feud between the families. However, their happiness is short-lived as a street brawl breaks out, leading to the deaths of Romeo\\'s friend Mercutio and Juliet\\'s cousin Tybalt. Romeo, enraged by Mercutio\\'s death, kills Tybalt in retaliation. \\n\\nAs a consequence, Romeo is banished by the Prince of Verona. Before he leaves, he spends the night with Juliet, who is unaware of Tybalt\\'s death and Romeo\\'s involvement. \\n\\n**Act 3:**\\n\\nJuliet\\'s parents, unaware of her secret marriage, arrange for her to marry Count Paris. Distraught, Juliet seeks help from Friar Lawrence, who devises a plan to keep her from having to marry Paris. He gives her a sleeping potion that will make her appear dead, so she can be taken to the Capulet family tomb without being truly deceased. \\n\\nFriar Lawrence intends to send a message to Romeo, explaining the plan so he can rescue Juliet when she awakens, but the message fails to reach him. \\n\\n**Act 4:**\\n\\nBelieving Juliet to be truly dead, Romeo buys poison from an Apothecary in Mantua and returns to Verona to say goodbye to his love. He encounters Paris at the tomb, and the two fight, leading to Paris\\'s death. Romeo then grieves over Juliet\\'s body and drinks the poison, taking his own life. \\n\\n**Act 5:**\\n\\nJuliet awakens to find Romeo dead beside her. Heartbroken, she takes his dagger and stabs herself, choosing to die with her true love. The Friar, the Prince, and the heads of both families arrive at the tomb, only to discover the tragic outcome of their ongoing feud. \\n\\nMoved by the lovers\\' deaths, the Prince declares:\\n> \"For never was a story of more woe / Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.\"\\n\\nThe families are reconciled by their children\\'s deaths and agree to end their feud, building a golden statue of Juliet and a tomb for Romeo to symbolize their newfound peace. \\n\\nThe play ends with a message of hope, reminding us that even in the face of tragedy, love and understanding can prevail. \\n\\nThis timeless tale has been adapted countless times for stage, screen, and literature, and continues to capture the hearts of audiences around the world.' additional_kwargs={'documents': None, 'citations': None, 'search_results': None, 'search_queries': None, 'is_search_required': None, 'generation_id': 'dca7c55c-ebe3-49ef-85ac-781a894f56e1', 'token_count': {'input_tokens': 227.0, 'output_tokens': 674.0}} response_metadata={'documents': None, 'citations': None, 'search_results': None, 'search_queries': None, 'is_search_required': None, 'generation_id': 'dca7c55c-ebe3-49ef-85ac-781a894f56e1', 'token_count': {'input_tokens': 227.0, 'output_tokens': 674.0}} id='run-9c068b35-486d-4f0b-a89f-ebfad4af0997-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 227, 'output_tokens': 674, 'total_tokens': 901}\n",
