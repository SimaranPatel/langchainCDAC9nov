      "content=\"Romeo and Juliet is one of the most famous and enduring love stories of all time, a tragic tale of young love, passion, and fate. Here is a summary of the story:\\n\\n**Act 1:**\\n\\nThe play begins in Verona, Italy, where we are introduced to the ongoing feud between two prominent families, the House of Capulet and the House of Montague. Despite the animosity between their families, Romeo Montague and Juliet Capulet fall instantly in love when they meet at a masked ball hosted by the Capulets. \\n\\nRomeo, captivated by Juliet's beauty, approaches her and they share a passionate dance. They soon learn each other's identities and realize the depth of the conflict between their families, but this only intensifies their feelings for each other. \\n\\n**Act 2:**\\n\\nRomeo and Juliet secretly marry the very next day, with the help of Juliet's Nurse and Friar Lawrence, who hopes that this union might end the feud between the families. However, their happiness is short-lived as Juliet's cousin, Tybalt, recognizes Romeo's voice from the ball and challenges him to a duel. Romeo, now secretly married to Tybalt's cousin, refuses to fight, which angers his friend Mercutio, who then fights Tybalt himself. Mercutio is accidentally killed, and Romeo, enraged, kills Tybalt in retaliation. \\n\\nAs a consequence, Romeo is banished by the Prince of Verona, and Juliet's parents, unaware of her secret marriage, plan to marry her off to Count Paris. \\n\\n**Act 3:**\\n\\nDistraught and desperate, Juliet seeks help from Friar Lawrence, who devises a plan to keep her from having to marry Paris. He gives Juliet a sleeping draught that will make her appear dead, with the intention of sending a message to Romeo so he can return to Verona and take Juliet away when she wakes. \\n\\nJuliet takes the potion the night before her wedding to Paris, and the Friar's message is sent to Romeo via Friar John. \\n\\n**Act 4:**\\n\\nUnfortunately, the message to Romeo is delayed, and he does not receive news of the plan. Instead, he only hears that Juliet is dead, and, overcome with grief, he buys poison from an Apothecary and returns to Verona to die by her side. \\n\\nMeanwhile, Juliet wakes in the Capulet tomb to find Romeo's dead body. Realizing what has happened, she takes Romeo's knife and stabs herself, choosing to die with her true love. \\n\\n**Act 5:**\\n\\nThe deaths of Romeo and Juliet finally bring an end to the feud between the Capulet and Montague families, as the tragedy highlights the futility of their conflict. The play concludes with the Prince's powerful monologue, reflecting on the needless loss of life and the consequences of the families' hatred. \\n\\nRomeo and Juliet's story has become an iconic symbol of young love, and their tragic end serves as a reminder of the destructive power of familial feuds and the importance of reconciliation. \\n\\nThis timeless tale continues to capture the imaginations of audiences around the world, inspiring countless adaptations and remaining one of Shakespeare's most beloved and frequently performed plays.\" additional_kwargs={'documents': None, 'citations': None, 'search_results': None, 'search_queries': None, 'is_search_required': None, 'generation_id': 'ba95648f-2367-40df-9743-1ae01ac08a5e', 'token_count': {'input_tokens': 227.0, 'output_tokens': 659.0}} response_metadata={'documents': None, 'citations': None, 'search_results': None, 'search_queries': None, 'is_search_required': None, 'generation_id': 'ba95648f-2367-40df-9743-1ae01ac08a5e', 'token_count': {'input_tokens': 227.0, 'output_tokens': 659.0}} id='run-b01b23e0-138a-4451-a8b9-71441475e77f-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 227, 'output_tokens': 659, 'total_tokens': 886}\n",
